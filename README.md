# Digital-Ecosystem-for-Artificial-Creatures
This project involves creating a living digital ecosystem where artificial species powered by Large Language Models make autonomous decisions about survival, cooperation, and evolution. Each species uses an LLM (in my case, Llama 3.2) to analyze their environment and choose actions like hunting, gathering, socializing, or migrating—just like real organisms would.

Each creature has:
* Energy (like their health or battery level)
* Intelligence (how smart they are)
* Cooperation and Aggression (how friendly or hostile they are)
* A place to live (an X and Y position on a digital map)

How do they live?
* Every round (called a generation), each creature asks an AI (Llama 3.2) what to do next:
  * Should I hunt?
  * Gather food?
  * Socialize?
  * Hide?
  * Move to another place?
  * Or make babies (reproduce)?

* Depending on what they do, their energy goes up or down. If they have enough energy, they can make new baby creatures with slightly changed traits (like evolution).

* Meanwhile, the environment changes too: food gets added or eaten, temperature goes up and down, threats appear.

What’s the point?
This project shows:
* How you can use AI to give fake creatures a “mind”.
* How they might adapt to a changing world — if the AI replies were smarter.
* How to visualize and study this digital life, just like scientists study nature.

Overall, It seems like a fun experiment where you play god, coding creatures and an environment, and watching how they survive, interact, and hopefully evolve!
